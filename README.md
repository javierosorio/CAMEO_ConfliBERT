# CAMEO ConfliBERT

This repository contains the replication package for the CAMEO ConfliBERT project.

This project aims at coding event data from newspaper articles according to the categories of the CAMEO ontology using the pre-trained language model ConfliBERT.

The Conflict and Mediation Event Observations (CAMEO) is the industry standard ontology for coding event data on political conflict and cooperation.  To code CAMEO event data, this project relies on ConfliBERT, a novel language model specifically developed to conduct a variety of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks in the political violence and conflict domain.
